-------Template Driven Fro

The bottom line here is that the template-driven form's approach minimizes
the component class code we need to write, but it is heavy on the template
code.
Each control takes a full page of HTML. When using template-driven forms,
Angular automatically creates the form model. We can then use that to track
form and control state, and the ngModel two-way data binding takes care of
keeping our classs properties in sync.
But often in a real app forms are more complex than this.
